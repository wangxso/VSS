# V2X Security System

**Secure Communication and Data Integrity for the Connected Vehicle Ecosystem**

## Overview

The V2X Security System is a state-of-the-art solution designed to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of data exchanged within the Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) ecosystem. Leveraging the robust capabilities of PanoSim for comprehensive simulation and the Xdja PKI System for certificate management, this system provides a secure foundation for connected vehicles to communicate effectively and safely.

## Key Features

- **End-to-End Encryption**: Employs advanced cryptographic techniques to secure all V2X communications.
- **Certificate Management**: Utilizes the Xdja PKI System for efficient issuance, revocation, and validation of digital certificates.
- **Simulation and Testing**: Integrates seamlessly with PanoSim for extensive testing and validation of V2X security protocols in various scenarios.
- **Scalability and Flexibility**: Designed to accommodate the growing number of connected devices and evolving security threats.
- **Compliance and Standards**: Adheres to industry standards and regulations for V2X communication security.

## System Requirements

- **Python 3.x**: Ensure you have the latest Python version for optimal performance.
- **PanoSim**: Access to PanoSim for simulation and testing purposes.
- **Xdja PKI System**: A fully operational Xdja PKI System for certificate services.

## Installation

To set up the V2X Security System, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/wangxso/VSS.git
   cd VSS
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure the Xdja PKI System**:
   - Ensure your Xdja PKI System is properly configured and accessible.
   - Update the `pki_config.py` file with your PKI system's details.

4. **Integrate with PanoSim**:
   - Set up your PanoSim environment as per the provided documentation.
   - Modify the `panosim_integration.py` to align with your specific simulation setup.

## Usage

To use the V2X Security System, run the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will initiate the system, integrating with both PanoSim and the Xdja PKI System to provide a secure V2X communication environment.
